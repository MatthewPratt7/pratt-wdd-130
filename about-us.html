            Our History
        </h2>

        <p class="our-history">
            Our company has a long history of running the Snake River, with over 50 years of experience. Since 2001 we’ve been owned and operated by the Great Salt Lake Council, Boy Scouts of America. But our history began many years before that. Since 1959 Boy Scouts have floated the Snake in good ol’ fashioned aluminum canoes. Running the river was a different sport back then when life jackets were optional but baby oil for the perfect summer tan was not.

            Eventually, in the 1970s the boys wanted a taste of the good stuff (whitewater that is) and so the camp expanded to include other activities, including whitewater rafting.
        </p>

        <p class="our-history">
            For many years the camp was associated with Lone Eagle Whitewater Rafting, and in 2001 the Great Salt Lake Council BSA officially purchased Lone Eagle which later became Teton Whitewater. Because of our history, we love spending time on the river, whether it’s on a beautiful scenic trip (reminiscent of our canoeing days) or on an adventurous whitewater trip.

            Since that first summer in 1959, our company has maintained the tradition of having great respect for the river and the abundant wildlife that surround it.

                <p class="abtus-m">Arne is Teton Whitewater’s loveable manager/head honcho. Born on the banks of a mystical river, Arne loves kayaking, rafting, laughing and singing interpretatively. Something interesting about Arne is that he’s a real Norwegian Viking, red beard & all! He is fluent in English, Chinese, and sarcasm. Arne's favorite color is shiny, and he has never, and I mean NEVER lost a tickle fight! He has YEARS of experience on the river and knows it like the back of his hand, believe it or not he has done over 2,000 runs on the Snake!</p>
