            <p>
                I have chosen to use the following fonts for my site:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    RocknRoll One: Used for headlines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Open Sans: Used for the primary font.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
            <p>
                I am a website developer.
                I manage a whitewater rafting company.
                I create websites catered to outdoor recreation.
                I specialize in helping create user friendly experiences to booking customers for outdoor activities.
                Think about the last time you booked your family for an outdoor recreation activity? Was it easy, intuitive, 
                easy to navigate? I promise what I can offer is a customizable, intuitive experience that removes the need for 
                employees while bringing in more revenue.

            <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
            <p>
                 The purpose of Oars Whitewater is to generate revenue through the selling of our services (whitewater rafting
                 and scenic float trips) in order to fund our other ventures and philanthropic causes. Profits from these trips go 
                 toward many things such as scholarships, treatments centers, and other charitable endeavors. Along with this we 
                 are dedicated to providing well paying and enjoyable jobs that can sustain a healthy and happy lifestyle for all 
                 of our employees and their families. We want to be a functional contributing company to society and the economy.

                 user-friendly website or over the phone for those who are potentially disabled or unable to use the internet properly.
